# 1st and 2nd Spiced Project

## Description
This was the first and second project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. The first project consisted in creating the structure with html and css and the 2nd project incorporated interactive elements with javascript to the website.
It was a solo-project, in which I created a basic quiz application using vanilla JS.

## Key Learnings
- create and populate HTML elements with JS using querySelector, append and adding classes
- mapping through objects to create as many cards as info is provided for them
- applying basic CSS-styling like adding colors, hovering effects, elements of responsive design and rounded edges
- implementing a dark-mode setting which changes the apps background and text colors

## Additional info
At this stage, all the quiz data was hard coded as an object of questions and answers. Also, some of the elements like the profile mock a user profile rather than giving the ability to sign in and save the game's progress.
