This was the first project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. It was a solo-project, in which I created a basic quiz application using vanilla JS.
I learned how to create and populate HTML elements with JS using querySelector, append and adding classes functions.
Also, I put into practice some first CSS-styling, adding colors, hovering effects elements of responsive design and rounded edges. It even features a dark-mode setting which changes the apps background and text colors.
At this stage, all the quiz data was hard coded as an objects of questions and answers.
